Github actions is a very popular and extensible CI/CD platform.
But when it comes to testing workflows in GitHub actions, Github doesnâ€™t provide any tools for local testing.


Luckily we have an open-source tool for testing Github action workflows locally.

The tool is available across all platforms and a detailed instruction on usage and installation can be found in their [GitHub Readme https://github.com/nektos/act#readme](https://github.com/nektos/act#readme)
